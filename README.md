## 🤝 Purpose
Coordinating events with friends is often messy and time-consuming. Existing tools felt either too basic or too complex. LinkApp bridges the gap by combining **ease of use**, **real-time communication**, and **AI-powered suggestions** to help groups quickly decide where to go and what to do.
